The Life Ontology (LifO) is an ontology of the life of an organism.

LifO represents the life processes of organisms and related entities and relations. LifO is a general purpose ontology that covers the common features associated with different types of organisms such as unicellular prokaryotes (e.g., E. coli) and multicellular organisms (e.g., humans). 

LifO is developed based on the OneNet Theory of Life. See more information about the OneNet theory: [http://www.hegroup.org/onenettheory.html](http://www.hegroup.org/onenettheory.html)
