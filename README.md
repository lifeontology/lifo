The Life Ontology (LifO) is an ontology of the life of organism.

LifO represents the life processes of organisms and related entities and relations. LifO is a general purpose ontology that covers the common features associated with different types of organisms such as unicellular prokaryotes (e.g., <i>E. coli</i>) and multicellular organisms (e.g., human). 

LifO is developed based on the OneNet Theory of Life. The OneNet theory is described in the paper: He Y. Ontology-based vaccine and drug adverse event representation and theory-guided systematic causal network analysis towards integrative pharmacovigilance research. <i>Current Pharmacology Reports</i>. 2016 Jun;2(3):113-128.
